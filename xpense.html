                    <p class="project_desc">Xpense app is great help for those who have a limited budget but are bad
                        at keeping it. It can be best for the youngsters, as they do not have any
                        control over how they spend money. We have developed the Xpense app
                        that provides the report of monthly expenses. Whether users want to track
                        personal costs or daily expenses, Xpense app helps to create spending
                        records</p>
                    <p class="project_desc">We tried to make our application look minimalistic and simple so that it will
                        be easy for users to use the application and to understand the functionality.
                        It is a very easy process from start to end by which user can track their
                        expenses. Firstly, new users must register themselves from signup page
                        and login to their account by providing their email and password. after this
                        they must input their monthly income and save it. Then user will be able to
                        add their expenses one by one after saving their monthly income. From the
                        add expenses page user can check the list of total expenses he/she added
                        till now. From this page user can add more expenses or also he/she can
                        view their report from which they can see how much expenses they have
                        on monthly bases. Report also shows the monthly savings according to the
                        income and expenses</p>
