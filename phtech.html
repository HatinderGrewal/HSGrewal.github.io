                    <p class="project_desc">E-Commerce (Electronic Commerce) is process of doing business through computer
                        networks. The primary goal of an e-commerce site is to sell goods and services online. Online 
                        shopping is a form of electronic shopping store where the buyer is directly online to the seller's
                        computer usually via the internet. User can login into e-commerce website, once he logged in then
                        automatically one shopping cart will be created, once user select an item it will add to cart.
                        In case user thinks the selected item is not useful for him, then he can delete that item form
                        the cart. The proposed system helps in building a website to buy products or goods online using
                        internet connection. Unlike traditional commerce that is carried out physically with effort of
                        a person to get products, e-commerce has made it easier for human to reduce physical work and
                        to save time. The basic concept of the application is to allow the customer to shop virtually 
                        using the Internet and allow customers to buy computer hardware and peripherals of their desire
                        from the store.</p>
                    <p class="project_desc">This is a web application and I worked on this website with my team members. we
                        used python for backend development and for front end we used html and some bootstrap. we used Django
                        framework also. Our teachers helped a lot to develop this web application. And this was just a prototype 
                        website. so, this was never hosted and we didnt buy any domain for this. this whole project was only for
                        learning purpose.
